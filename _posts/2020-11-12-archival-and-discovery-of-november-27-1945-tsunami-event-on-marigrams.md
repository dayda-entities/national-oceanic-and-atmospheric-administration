These water level data were digitized from a scanned marigram image associated with the tsunami event of 1945-11-27 at a tide gauge located at Karachi, Pakistan, and referenced to station datum.  The Karachi marigram is one of the two instrumental records existing of the 1945 Makran tsunami and spans most of the 16 days between November 15 and December 1.  The original Karachi analog record belongs to the Survey of India (SOI) and was collected and digitized by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) and Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) for use in the publication of a few scientific papers.  This digital marigram scan was reformatted into the accompanying digital, numerical time series by the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), Boulder, CO. Acknowledgement of SOI, NIO, and INCOIS should be included in any future scientific works using this record.
