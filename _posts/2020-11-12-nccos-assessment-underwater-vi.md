The presence and absence of the four substrate and four biological cover types were documented at 1,353 locations on the insular shelf south of St. Thomas and St. John. At each location, an underwater camera system was used to collect high definition (HD) video at 30 frames per second at 1080x1920 resolution.  This GIS dataset depicts the location of these underwater videos, as well as the name, location, time collected, and the presence and absence of the substrate and cover types. A portion of these underwater videos (n=1,005) were used to develop the habitat predictions and the composite habitat map. A separate subset of these underwater videos (n=348) were used to assess the performance of the habitat predictions and accuracy of the composite habitat map.
