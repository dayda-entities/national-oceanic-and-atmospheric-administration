This Global Summaries dataset, known as GSOM for Monthly, contains a monthly resolution of meteorological elements from 1763 to present with updates applied weekly. The major parameters are: monthly mean maximum, mean minimum and mean temperatures; monthly total precipitation and snowfall; departure from normal of the mean temperature and total precipitation; monthly heating and cooling degree days; number of days that temperatures and precipitation are above or below certain thresholds; extreme daily temperature and precipitation amounts; number of days with fog; and number of days with thunderstorms. The primary input data source is the Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily) dataset. The Global Summaries datasets also include a yearly resolution of meteorological elements in the GSOY (for Yearly) dataset. See associated resources for more information. These datasets are not to be confused with "GHCN-Monthly", "Annual Summaries" or "NCDC Summary of the Month". There are unique elements that are produced globally within the GSOM and GSOY data files. There are also bias corrected temperature data in GHCN-Monthly, which are not available in GSOM and GSOY. The GSOM and GSOY datasets replace the legacy U.S. COOP Summaries (DSI-3220), and have been expanded to include non-U.S. (global) stations. U.S. COOP Summaries (DSI-3220) only includes National Weather Service (NWS) COOP Published, or "Published in CD", sites.
