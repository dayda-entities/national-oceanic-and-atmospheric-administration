The Habitat Use Database (HUD) was specifically designed to address the need for habitat-use analyses in support of groundfish EFH, HAPCs, and fishing and nonfishing impacts components of the 2005 EFH EIS. 
HUD functionality and accessibility, and the ecological information upon which the HUD is based, will be  improved in order for this database to fully support fisheries and ecosystem science and management. Upgrades to and applications of the HUD will be facilitated through a series of prioritized phases:

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Fully integrate the data entry, quality control, and reporting capabilities from the original HUD Access database with a web-based and programmatic interface. Improve software for HUD to accommodate the most current habitat maps and habitat classification codes. This will be achieved by NMFS in consultation with HUD architects at Oregon State University.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Review and update the biological and ecological information in the HUD. 

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Develop and apply improved models that will be used to create updated habitat suitability maps for all west coast groundfish species using the updated HUD and Pacific coast seafloor habitat maps.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Integrate habitat suitability models with the online groundfish EFH data catalog
