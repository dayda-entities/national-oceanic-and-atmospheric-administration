Local Climatological Data (LCD) are summaries of climatological conditions from airport and other prominent weather stations managed by NWS, FAA, and DOD. The product includes hourly observations and associated remarks, and a record of hourly precipitation for the entire month. Also included are daily summaries summarizing temperature extremes, degree days, precipitation amounts and winds. The tabulated monthly summaries in the product include maximum, minimum, and average temperature, temperature departure from normal, dew point temperature, average station pressure, ceiling, visibility, weather type, wet bulb temperature, relative humidity, degree days (heating and cooling), daily precipitation, average wind speed, fastest wind speed/direction, sky cover, and occurrences of sunshine, snowfall and snow depth. The source data is global hourly (DSI 3505) which includes a number of quality control checks.
