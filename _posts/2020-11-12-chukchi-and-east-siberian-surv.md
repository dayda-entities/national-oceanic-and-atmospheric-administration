The Chukchi and East Siberian Surveys (ChESS) were a joint U.S.-Russian effort to enumerate ice-associated seals and polar bears in the Chukchi and East Siberian seas. ChESS is a component of the Loss of Sea Ice (LOSI) initiative, which is a multi-disciplinary effort led by the Habitat and Ecological Processes Research (HEPR) Program at NOAA Fisheriesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Alaska Fisheries Science Center. 

The focus of this project was to provide baseline distribution and abundance data for breeding populations of bearded and ringed seals in the Chukchi Sea and to provide additional polar bear population estimates. Russian colleagues conducted aerial surveys in the western Chukchi and east Siberian seas while U.S. colleagues conducted surveys in the eastern Chukchi Sea. These surveys were designed to occur concurrently using similar methodology.
