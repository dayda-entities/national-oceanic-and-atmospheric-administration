Marine recreational fishing is a popular pastime across the United States that generates significant economic impacts to both local economies and to the nation.  In this survey, the level of fishing expenditures for anglers was quantified within each coastal state and the U.S. as a whole.  The primary objectives of the national expenditure surveys are to collect trip expenditures for an anglerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s most recent marine recreational fishing trip and to collect annual expenditures on durable goods used for marine recreational fishing.  Additional objectives include obtaining a profile of the most recent marine recreational fishing trip and collecting demographic information on marine recreational anglers.
